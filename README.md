<img src="nbt_diagram.png">

<h6 align="center">Currently this open source version is a work in progress and does not auto trade real money.</h6>

<h4 align="center">NBT is an open cryptocurrency trading bot development framework for the Binance exchange.</h4>

NBT includes 3 main JS scripts:

* a script to run the **server** (OPTIONAL):

  * to track a selection of asset pairs and record all their binance data (candles, depths, trades) into text files.
  * if a buy or sell signal condition is detected, the server will emit a web socket signal to:
    * the concurrent running trader client.
    * (optional) the NBT Hub / [Bitcoin vs. Altcoins](https://bitcoinvsaltcoins.com) to monitor your strategies and signals.

* a script to run the **auto trader**:
  * to follow and compute the performances for each strategy and signal received via web socket from the server or the NBT Hub.

* a script to **backtest** your strategies on the recorded historical data.
